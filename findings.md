# Findings

This document serves to detail any findings from data in the `data` folder. All graphs are generated from scripts in the `scripts` folder using Python library [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Age

Investigating the average age of bakers reveals the following chart.

This shows that the maximum average age was from Series 5, and the minimum was from Series 10.
## Star Bakers

It would seem a pretty straight forward conclusion that the number of Star Bakers per contestant correlates with a better finishing place. Investigating this directly shows the following results.

This assumption seems pretty well established from the chart. However, this correlation is not perfect as seen in the discrepency between the winners and runner-ups averages. 

Also one thing to note is the 12th place Star Baker row is currently useful, as the current show format does not allow 12th place bakers to also recieve a Star Baker.
